This repository contains samples of my work in R

1. GT Homework - samples of my homework assignments in analytics modeling course (Georgia Institute of Technology, 
Online MSc in Analytic program)

2. Moneyball - I worked on this project on my spare time and it was fun! I was inspired by movie "Moneyball", and decided to 
model the story from the movie in R. I used public baseball data to develop an algorithm looking for undervalued players in MLB.

3. Predicting MLB Pitcher Salaries - this is another student course work. It was a group project in one of the analytics courses I took
working toward my MBA degree. My personal contribution was writing R script (data wrangling and building predictive models), as well as 
sketching the team report.

4. Economist_plot - a cool scatter plot I built in R to replicate similar report published in the Economist magazine.

I sincerely enjoy working with data and love to share my knowledge with others. Here is a link to Google Drive folder with a short video
tutorial I recorded for university students to show how to connect R and Tableau to run analytics models in R, and then visualize results 
in Tableau https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1auwNd9H_ihl0R3XRcbZx_Ou-pZaFEM_C?usp=sharing
